Last week I had the oppurtunity to speak at the [Tweakers Developers Summit](https://tweakers.net/partners/devsummit2023/1900/sprekerstracks/) in Utrecht, the Netherlands.

The event consisted of several tracks including, front-end, back-end, DevOps, security, smart home, and AI. The venue was the awesome De Fabrique (old industrial complex) and it was packed with developers. I really enjoyed watching the keynote by [Linda Liukas](http://lindaliukas.com/), the author of the [Hello Ruby](http://www.helloruby.com/) book series. It was really inspiring to hear her talk about how children (and adults!) can learn programming concepts in a playful way.

My session, which was part of the back-end track, covered how [Dapr](https://dapr.io) speeds up distributed systems development by using the many building block APIs. The preceding session named _From Monolith to Microservices and Beyond_ was a great lead-in to my session (thanks again Peter van Vliet!).

The slides can be <a href="/articles/2023/116.tweakers-dev-summit-presentation.pdf" target="_blank">downloaded here</a>. If you want to learn more about Dapr or have questions about the project, please join the [Dapr Discord](http://bit.ly/dapr-discord).
