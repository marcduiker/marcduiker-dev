Last Thursday and Friday I was in Vilnius Lithuania for [BuildStuff 2023](https://www.buildstuff.events/). I gave my session _"Orchestrating your business logic reliably with workflow as code"_ on Friday. It was my first time at this conference (also my first time in Lithuania) and I really enjoyed it. The conference was very well organized, I loved the under water theme (with all the deep dive sessions ðŸ¤¿), and I met with both old and new friends ðŸ¤—. Thanks everyone for attending my session, being patient when the projector failed ðŸ˜…, and for asking great questions after the session!
