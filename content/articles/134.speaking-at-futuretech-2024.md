On April 17th, I spoke at the [FutureTech](https://futuretech.nl) conference in Utrecht, the Netherlands. I gave a session about Dapr Actors, one of [Dapr](https://dapr.io) APIs that allows you to build distributed and concurrent applications using the Actor Model.

Next to my session, there were two other Dapr related sessions:

- _DAPR and .NET Aspire: A royal wedding_ by Florian van Dillen
- _Building Future-Ready Apps with .NET 8 and Azure Serverless Ecosystem_ by Stas Lebedenko

It was awesome to see so much Dapr content at a conference like FutureTech!

As usual, I brought plenty of Dapr stickers for the conference attendees. All of them were gone by the end of the day üòÅ.

Thanks to the organizers of FutureTech for inviting me and organizing this event! I really enjoyed meeting many former colleagues and friends again. The speaker dinner the evening before was an excellent opportunity to connect with peers and meet lovely new people.
