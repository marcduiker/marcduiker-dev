On June 25th, I spoke at the [dotnet2024](https://dotnetconfspain.com/) conference in Madrid, Spain. My session was titled: *Failure is not an option: Durable Execution + Dapr = ðŸš€* and covered how [Dapr](https://dapr.io) has built-in features and APIs that helps developers building resilient distributed applications.

This was the first conference session where I only used VSCode for both slides and demos (no PowerPoint or Keynote). I'm using the [CodeTour extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) to drive the presentation. Please have a look at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/diagrid-labs/dapr-resiliency-and-durable-execution) with the demos and slides, clone it locally and give CodeTour a try! 

I finally got the opportunity to meet [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/) who gave a great keynote session at this conference. He really is an inspiration to me, he is very thoughful in everything he does, and a very skilled speaker.

Thanks to Unai Zorilla Castra ([Plain Concepts](https://www.plainconcepts.com/)) and other organizers of dotnet2024 for inviting me, making me feel welcome, and creating such a good conference! It was great meeting with both old and new speaker friends there. I hope to be another time!
