I made another retro game! This time it's a Dapr inspired game that I made for KubeCon Paris 2024 for people to play at the Diagrid booth (see some video's in [this post](./132.kubecon-paris-2024.md)). The player needs to avoid rogue messages, collect Dapr coins and the Dapr hat, in order to get to the development team and share their Dapr knowledge. The game has an educational element because after a level is completed some Dapr information is shared with the player.

I made the game with [Pico8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), a fantasy game console for making, sharing, and playing retro games. I re-used some sprites from one of my earlier games and added new features such as the gray/blue powerlines to limit player movement once the Dapr hat is collected.
