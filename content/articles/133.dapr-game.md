I made another retro game! This time it's a Dapr inspired game that I made for KubeCon Paris 2024 for people to play at the Diagrid booth (see some video's in [this post](./132.kubecon-paris-2024.md)). The player needs to avoid rogue messages, collect Dapr coins and the Dapr hat, in order to get to the development team and share their Dapr knowledge. The game has an educational element because after a level is completed some Dapr information is shared with the player.

I made the game with [Pico8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), a fantasy game console for making, sharing, and playing retro games. I had a lot of fun drawing all the sprites, like the computers and the groups of developers, designing the sound effects, and composing the music. The gameplay is very similar to the Azure Functions game, but I added some new gameplay features, such as the gray/blue powerlines to limit player movement once the Dapr hat is collected. At the moment the game consists of 3 levels, but I will add a couple more over time.
