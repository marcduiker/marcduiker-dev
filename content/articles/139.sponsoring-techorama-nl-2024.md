On October 8 & 9 I was at [Techorama Netherlands](https://techorama.nl/) because Diagrid was sponsoring this event. Techorama is the best .NET / Azure focused conference in the Netherlands, and I was really looking forward to be there. The Techorama events are always themed, this year it was a _fun fair_ edition, and wow, they delivered! 🎉 The venue was decorated with a lot of fun fair elements, and there were carnival rides outside! 🎡

Diagrid was silver sponsor this year and I prepared a life-size pixelart sidecar motorcycle for our booth. Attendees 'sat' in the sidear and I took their picture with an instant camera. I had a lot of fun preparing for this and most people did get the reference of the sidecar (Dapr usses the sidecar pattern, since the Dapr process runs next to the application process).

I did notice that for some people it felt a bit too awkward to sit in the sidecar to have their picture taken. So, on the second day, I decided to leave the sidecar as decoration and have attendees play the Dapr game instead. This worked much better to attract people to the booth, and a lot of people played the game! 🕹️

This year my colleague Alice joined me at the booth and this made the conference much more enjoyable and easier compared to last year when I was by myself! Thanks Alice! 🙏

I had so much fun at this conference! I met so many former colleagues, and people I have worked with during my consultancy years. And I met a great deal of new(ish) people, even some who remembered me from previous year when Diagrid sponsored Techorama. I hope to see all of you again next year! 👋
