From August 28-30 I was in Denmark to speak at the [Copenhagen Developers Festival](https://cphdevfest.com/), a conference organized by [NDC Conferences](https://ndcconferences.com/). NDC always organizes excellent developer conferences and this was no exception. I really like the festival format where more creative aspects are included such as music, comedy, game shows, and using code for music and visuals (creative coding! ü§©).

My session was on the second day of the conference and was titled: _Failure is not an option: Durable Execution + Dapr = üöÄ_. In this session, I demonstrated [Dapr Workflow](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/workflow-overview/), various workflow patterns, and Dapr [resiliency policies](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/resiliency/policies/).

All the code I demonstrated can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/diagrid-labs/dapr-resiliency-and-durable-execution). 

There were quite some sessions about distributed applications or topics closely related to it. Layla Porter presented about the 'modular monolith' and Loek Duys had a session about Radius, where he referenced (and demo-ed) Dapr.

I had a great time at this conference, I had good conversations with some Dapr enthusiasts (I hope to welcome you on the [Dapr Discord](https://bit.ly/dapr-discord)!), and as always it's great to catch up with my peers (some are my former colleagues ü§ó). 

Thanks again to the program committee for accepting my talk, and thanks to the attendees for giving me a great rating! üôè I hope to be around next year again. Maybe even to perform some live [creative coding](/creative-coding)! ü§î
