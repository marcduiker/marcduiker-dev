# 👋 Hi, I am Marc Duiker

I'm a developer advocate who loves to code, write, and draw, to help developers achieve more every day. 🚀

I have a long history with .NET, Azure, serverless ⚡️, and event-driven architectures ✉️. These days I'm creating content around Dapr, the distributed application runtime, which allows me to explore more programming languages and cloud platforms! 🤩

When I'm not working to improve the developer experience, I am either drawing some [pixel art](/pixelart) for fun, doing [creative coding](creative-coding) in JavaScript to create interactive visuals, or creating soundscapes with my modular synth 🎛️.

Check the [about page](/about) if you want to contact me. See you around! 👋
