On October 30 & 31, I was invited to [Heapcon](https://heapcon.io/2025) in Belgrade Serbia to give my session, *'Start building distributed applications with ease using building block APIs'*. It was my first time at this community-driven conference, and it was a really nice experience. It was clear that the organizers have been doing this for several years now, as the entire event ran super smoothly. Thank you, Iva Jovanović and Viktor Bajraktar, for making me feel so welcome!

At the conference I met two other Dutch speakers: Niek Palm, who gave a session about GitHub Actions security, and Niek van de Ven, who gave a very engaging session about public speaking.

One of the highlights outside the conference was a dinner with some of the speakers and organizers at a brewery called Docker. Thanks for the great company and conversations!

This is the [repo with the demos](https://github.com/diagrid-labs/dapr-building-block-apis). It comes with a devcontainer configuration so you can run it yourself easily, either on GitHub Codespaces or locally. And you can use Demo Time to run through the slides and all the demos.
