On March 13th, I was at [FutureTech](https://futuretech.nl/) in the Netherlands to give my session *'Failure is not an option: Durable Execution + Dapr = ðŸš€'*.

FutureTech is an in-person conference in the Netherlands that focuses on Microsoft technologies, such as .NET & Azure. This year the opening was very special, two of the organizers, Anjuli Jhakry and Dennis Vroegop, took the stage and performed a duet of Shallow by Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper. Kudos to them for their courage and great performance! ðŸ’ª

My session was near the end of the afternoon, and I was happy to see so many people at my session, eager to learn more about durable execution with Dapr Workflow!

For my session, I used [DemoTime](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eliostruyf.vscode-demo-time) again, a VSCode extension created by [Elio Struyf](https://bsky.app/profile/eliostruyf.com), to navigate through my slides (Markdown) and code, and also execute the `dapr run` commands for running my Dapr demos. Elio keeps improving this extension and I can recommend it to everyone who does live coding demos using VSCode!

This is the [repo with the demos](https://github.com/diagrid-labs/dapr-resiliency-and-durable-execution). It comes with a devcontainer configuration so you can run it yourself easily, either on GitHub Codespaces or locally. And you can use DemoTime to run through the slides and demos.

It's good to see more sessions & workshops about distributed applications these days, such as the Microsoft Orleans session by Lindsay Broos, and the Dapr workshop by Edwin van Wijk and Sander Molenkamp.

I really enjoyed catching up with other members of the community. I spoke with Pieter de Bruin about improving the Dapr docs and developer experience in general. And Rick van den Bosch invited me to speak at [DotNetZuid](https://www.dotnetzuid.nl/), thanks!

A big thank you to all the FutureTech organizers for organizing a great developer event, and for having me present about Dapr. And thanks to the attendees for joining my session (and giving me feedback)!
