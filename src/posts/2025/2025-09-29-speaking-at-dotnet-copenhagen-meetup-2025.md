On September 29, I was at the [.NET Copenhagen Meetup](https://ndccopenhagen.com/) in Denmark to give my session, *'Failure is not an option: Durable Execution + Dapr = 🚀'*. This was a Dapr-focussed meetup and was the result of a collaboration between Mauricio Salatino, Alejandro Montenegro, Morten Christensen and myself.

Mauricio started off with a session about "Cloud Native Developer Experience". Then I presented my session about Dapr Workflow and resiliency. And finally, Morten closed the event with a session about how Novo Nordisk is using Dapr".

For my session, I used [DemoTime](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eliostruyf.vscode-demo-time), a VSCode extension created by [Elio Struyf](https://bsky.app/profile/eliostruyf.com), to navigate through my slides (Markdown) and code, and also execute the `dapr run` commands for running my Dapr demos. It worked great and ensured I filled my 60-minute slot perfectly. This time, I also included [EngageTime](https://engagetime.live/) to interact with the audience using polls and share session resources with them.

This is the [repo with the demos](https://github.com/diagrid-labs/dapr-resiliency-and-durable-execution). It comes with a devcontainer configuration so you can run it yourself easily, either on GitHub Codespaces or locally. And you can use Demo Time to run through the slides and all the demos.

It was great seeing Jonah Andersson again! She's a longtime developer community enthusiast and very active in the Azure scene. Thank you for coming over all the way from Sweden to say hi!

A big thank you to Alejandro & Google for hosting and Morten for organizing the .NET Copenhagen meetup.
