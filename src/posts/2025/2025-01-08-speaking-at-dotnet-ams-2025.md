On Jan 8th, I gave my first presentation of the year at the [.NET Amsterdam Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/dotnet-amsterdam/)! This meetup is close to my heart since I've attended many of their meetups in the past and also got the opportunity to speak there a couple of times.

The meetup was hosted by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) in their beautiful Amsterdam office. I was welcomed by Sasha Kolesova, the product marketing manager for .NET tools at JetBrains, and the .NET meetup organizers,  Erik Lieben and Thimo van Leeuwen.

Thie meetup was themed around [Dapr](https://dapr.io/), I started with a Dapr introduction session, explaining the Dapr building blocks and doing demos on switching out state store components and showing the built-in resiliency features. The demos I used are available in the [Dapr Quickstarts](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts) repo on GitHub.

The second session was by Florian van Dillen, who demonstrated in great detail how you can use .NET Aspire with Dapr to create distributed applications suitable for production. His demo application can be found [here](https://github.com/fvandillen/dapr-aspire).
