On September 10-11, I was at [NDC Copenhagen](https://ndccopenhagen.com/) in Denmark to give my session *'Async messaging deep dive with Dapr, take your pub/sub skills to the next level 📨🚀'*.

The NDC conferences are known for their solid and diverse speaker lineup. They also take great care of their speakers 🙏. I consider myself very fortunate to have been part of this event again. This was my second time at the Copenhagen edition. [Last year](../speaking-at-cphdevfest-2024) the event was named Copenhagen Developer Festival; this year it was rebranded to NDC Copenhagen (similar to the other NDC conferences). I have to say I did miss the festival elements from last year, which then included Matt Parker (the stand-up maths comedian), live-coding music sessions, and demo scene talks. Maybe more artsy elements can be included again next year? I did appreciate the live music performances using a modular synthesizer and a theremin during the breaks.

For my session, I used [DemoTime](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eliostruyf.vscode-demo-time), a VSCode extension created by [Elio Struyf](https://bsky.app/profile/eliostruyf.com), to navigate through my slides (Markdown) and code, and also execute the `dapr run` commands for running my Dapr demos. It worked great and ensured I filled my 60-minute slot perfectly. This time, I also included [EngageTime](https://engagetime.live/) to interact with the audience using polls and share session resources with them.

This is the [repo with the demos](https://github.com/diagrid-labs/dapr-pub-sub-deep-dive). It comes with a devcontainer configuration so you can run it yourself easily, either on GitHub Codespaces or locally. And you can use DemoTime to run through the slides and all the demos.

As usual, I had loads of stickers to share. The pixel art ones with the retro desktop computer are new this year!

I really enjoyed catching up with other members of the community. I met some lovely new (for me) 'speaker colleagues' as well 🤗.

A big thank you to all the NDC organizers and sponsors for organizing this great developer event and for inviting me to talk about Dapr. And thanks to the attendees for joining my session and giving me feedback! I'm happy with my rating of 23 green and 7 yellow cards 😊.
