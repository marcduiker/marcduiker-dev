On May 27th, Dana Arsovska and I gave a Dapr Agents workshop for the [PyLadies Amsterdam community](https://www.meetup.com/pyladiesams/events/307652222/?eventOrigin=group_events_list). Full credits go to Dana since she created the hands-on labs based on the Dapr Agents [quickstarts](https://github.com/dapr/dapr-agents/blob/main/quickstarts/README.md) and took the lead during this workshop. You did great!

The event was generously hosted by [JetBrains](https://jetbrains.com/). They have a wonderful office in the center of Amsterdam which was very suitable for our workshop. Thank you Lena for hosting and providing us with delicious pizza!

Running this workshop was a excellent opportunity for me to network with Python community members. It was great meeting the Pyladies organizers, Una and Giulia (thank you for your help during the workshop!), and I got introduced to Kally, one of the PyData Amsterdam organizers.

If you're interesting in trying Dapr Agents yourself, you can either run the hands-on labs [in this repo](https://github.com/pyladiesams/dapr-in-action-may2025) or try the [Dapr Agents quickstarts](https://github.com/dapr/dapr-agents/blob/main/quickstarts/README.md).
