On September 24, I was at [PyData Amsterdam](https://amsterdam.pydata.org/) with Dana Arsovska to give a Dapr Agents workshop.

Dana did a great job making a selection of [Dapr Agents quickstarts](https://github.com/dapr/dapr-agents/blob/main/quickstarts/README.md), changing it to use the HuggingFace client, and preparing the slide deck.

I was positively surprised to see so many people attend our workshop! Dana and I only provisioned 15 API keys, but we had about 50 attendees 😅. Due to the large group size, we ran into some rate-limiting issues when initializing the Dapr CLI (which starts pulling container images from the Docker registry). Luckily we could use the Dapr Agents track on the Instruqt platform that uses a cloud sandbox that is fully pre-configured (although the content was slightly different compared to what Dana had prepared). It was a good learning experience to be better prepared next time for a larger group (and completely switch to Instruqt for everyone). 

Many thanks to the PyData program committee and organizers for giving us the opportunity to do this workshop!
