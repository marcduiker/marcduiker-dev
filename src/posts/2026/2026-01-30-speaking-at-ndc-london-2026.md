On January 28-30, I was at [NDC London](https://ndclondon.com/) to give my session, *'Reliable Agentic Systems Require Durable Execution'*.

The NDC conferences are known for their solid speaker lineup and taking great care of their speakers 🙏. I consider myself very fortunate to have been part of their events once again.

My session is based on this blog post, [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) by the Anthropic Engineering team, and covers different agentic patterns that range from very deterministic to more probabilistic. The implementation in the demo apps is done with Dapr Workflow, the Dapr Conversation API, and local models run with Ollama.

This is the [repo with the demos](https://github.com/diagrid-labs/dapr-reliable-agentic-systems). It comes with a devcontainer configuration so you can run it yourself easily, either on GitHub Codespaces or locally. And you can use DemoTime to run through the slides and all the demos. 

I really enjoyed catching up with other members of the community. It was great meeting Andrew Poole for the first time. He also did his session with DemoTime and was using animated, hand-drawn diagrams, very impressive 🤯. I had so much fun during Davy Davidse's session about mazes and how to solve them. Love his dry sense of humour 🤣. David Whitney's session, *'Meditations on Code as Art'*, was really inspiring. That was truly a session close to my heart as I really enjoy creating art with code myself. And yes, I think code itself can also be seen as art. Lastly, it was great to see some creative coding at the NDC party where Alan Smith was coding/DJ-ing in [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/). Maybe I can do some creative coding with P5JS at the next NDC? 🤔

A big thank you to all the NDC organizers and sponsors for making this event happen, and thanks to the attendees for attending my session and giving me very positive feedback (84% green 🟩)!
