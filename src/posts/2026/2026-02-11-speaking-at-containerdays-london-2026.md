On February 11 and 12, I was at [Container Days London](https://www.containerdays.io/containerdays-london-2026/) to give my session, *'Decoupling your application code from your infrastructure with Dapr'*.

This was the first time Container Days was held in London, and I was positively surprised by the good turnout. Cloud-native tech is definitely top of mind in the UK.

I updated my session to include Dapr Workflow, which is becoming more and more popular, and this allowed me to demo the [Diagrid Dev Dashboard](https://www.diagrid.io/blog/improving-the-local-dapr-workflow-experience-diagrid-dashboard) to show how workflow state is stored and that the workflow is automatically resumed after an application crash and restart.

This is the [repo with the demos](https://github.com/diagrid-labs/dapr-building-block-apis). It comes with a devcontainer configuration so you can run it yourself easily, either on GitHub Codespaces or locally. And you can use DemoTime to run through the slides and all the demos. 

A big thank you to the Container Days organizers and sponsors for making this event happen, and thanks to the attendees for attending my session and providing me with positive feedback!
