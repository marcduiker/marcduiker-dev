From Wednesday 18th to Friday 20th October, I was at [NDC Porto](https://ndcporto.com/agenda) in Portugal. NDC organizes excellent developer conferences, and I was very happy my abstract _"orchestrating your business logic reliably with workflow as code"_ was accepted ü•≥.

By looking at the conference agenda, it was clear that microservices and (event-driven) architecture related talks are very popular currently, so my Dapr talk was a good fit üí™. I couldn't attend many of the other talks, unfortunately, but I'll watch them as soon as they're published on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ndc).

I'm glad my session was well attended, especially when someone like Richard Campbell is giving a talk at the same time üòÖ. Thanks to everyone for attending, and asking great questions afterwards. I hope to see you at another NDC conference again!

I really like meeting people at these conferences. I spoke to many developers who I haven't met before and talked about Dapr (and pixelart). I also (re)connected with some former colleagues and speaker friends ‚ù§Ô∏è. It was great to meet you all! ü§ó
