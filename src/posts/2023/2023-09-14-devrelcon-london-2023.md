The first [DevRelCon](https://developerrelations.com/devrelcon) I attended was in 2022 in Prague, where I had the opportunity to speak about how to use your non-IT skills to build your personal brand (perhaps some day the recording will be published üòÖ).

I had a superb time there, it really felt I was among my people ‚ù§Ô∏è. So when I noticed that the 2023 edition would be in London, I immediately bought a ticket.

## Creating the logo

Not long after the 2022 conference, Matthew Revell, the conference organizer, approached me and asked if I would like to create the logo for the London conference. Of course, I immediately said yes to this!
Many hours of drawing followed, and I'm very happy with the result.

Here's the time-lapse of the creation of the logo:

## The conference

After a smooth Eurostar travel from Rotterdam to London, I went to the pre-conference drinks, where I met some of my lovely former colleagues and many new folks.
There was a surprising large Dutch devrel delegation, some I've never met before üò≤ (Thanks Julien for bringing the stroopwafels!).

The main reason I went to this conference is to (re)connect with the wonderful people in Developer Relations.
Don't get me wrong, the talks are good. I've learned quite a bit about:

- Developer education (Sue Smith)
- Cracking complext community problems (Richard Millington)
- Communication design (Melinda Seckington)
- Quantifying devrel impact (Kevin Lewis and John Booth).

There were many more talks, and a devrel unconference at the same time. It was too much to follow everything ü§Ø.
As our industry is relatively young and not well-defined, I'm very appreciative of everyone who is sharing their knowledge and experience. You are helping us all to grow up (this is a hot topic lately).

I got a lot of good energy from attending this conference and meeting everyone in person ü§ó. I hope a new edition of DevRelCon will happen in 2024. I will be there for sure!
