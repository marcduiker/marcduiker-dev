Last week I had the privilege to MC at MSBuild the Netherlands with [Stacy Cashmore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacycash/). This developer conference was the first local flagship developer conference organized by Microsoft in many years. The event was held at Media Plaza in Utrecht, the Netherlands.

Stacy and I were tasked with introducing the speakers, moderating the Q&A, and ensuring everyone sticks to the agenda. It all went quite smooth until halfway through April Edwards keynote, when one of the camera crew fell pretty badly and had to be taken to the hospital. This was the first time I ever encountered a situation like this at a conference. It made me realize that event organizers should be prepared for literally anything. We shuffled the agenda a bit and were on track again pretty quick. Major kudos to April, who helped stabilize the injured cameraman, and continued her keynote after a break.

The day was packed with good sessions around Azure, GitHub, AI, and Security. It was great to see so many people in person again, both attendees and community partners. At the end of the day, we gave away some prizes to people that shared their MSBuild selfie online (I wish I had won the MS Build branded Xbox!). I really enjoyed this day, and it was a great opportunity to wear my Dapr hat! üòÅ

For those of you that missed the in person event, you can watch the recordings of the sessions soon on the [Microsoft website](https://pulse.microsoft.com/nl-nl/microsoft-build-nl/).
