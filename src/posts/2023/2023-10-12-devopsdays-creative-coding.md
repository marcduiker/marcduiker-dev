I recently got an invite to do an [ignite talk](https://www.ignitetalks.io/) at [DevOpsDays Eindhoven](https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-eindhoven/welcome/). I never heard about the format, but it's a 5 minute long presentation with 20 slides that auto advance. I never tried this before but, at times, I like to go out of my comfort zone, so I said yes ðŸ˜¬.

The topic I chose is one I love best: creative coding. I named named the session *"Stop adding business value and become and artist with your IT skills"*. 
I was quite nervous giving this talk but I also had a lot of fun! Thanks everyone for attending my session! 

My slides can be <a href="/assets/images/blog/2023/119.become-an-artist-with-your-it-skills.pdf" target="_blank">downloaded here</a>. A good starting point for learning [P5js](https://p5js.org) is [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) on YouTube. There is also an [awesome list on GitHub](https://github.com/terkelg/awesome-creative-coding) with links to many more creative coding resources to keep you busy for months!
