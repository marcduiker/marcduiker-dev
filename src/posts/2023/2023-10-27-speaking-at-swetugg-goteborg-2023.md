From Thursday 26th to Friday 27th October, I was at [Swetugg Göteborg](https://www.swetugg.se/gbg-2023) in Sweden. It was my first time at a Swetugg conference and I really enjoyed the experience.

I gave my session _"Start building applications with ease using building block APIs"_ on Thursday. Since a couple of speakers had to cancel their sessions, I volunteered to give an additional talk, _"Orchestrating your business logic reliably with workflow as code"_ on Friday. Thanks to everyone that attended!
