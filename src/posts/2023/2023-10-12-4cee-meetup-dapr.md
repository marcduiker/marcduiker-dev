Jeffrey Bosch invited me to give a tech talk at the 4CEE meetup in Ede on Thu 12th of Oct. It was a busy week with both [Techorama](/articles/sponsoring-techorama-nl-2023) and [DevOpsDays Eindhoven](/articles/devopsdays-creative-coding), but I was glad I could join this meetup and show people the benefits of building applications with [Dapr](https://dapr.io). The event was very well organized, the turn-out was great, and this was only the second time they organized such a thing! üëè

The other speaker at this meetup was Stacy Cashmore, who talked about creating a blog website using Blazor and Azure Static Web Apps. Stacy is a great speaker, I really enjoy her enthusiasm and the funny jokes she makes while doing live coding. üöÄ

I gave an introductory session about Dapr, the distributed application runtime, and demonstrated service-to-service invocation, pub/sub messaging, and state management. Thanks everyone for attending and asking good questions!

My slides can be <a href="/articles/2023/120.c4ee-dapr-101.pdf" target="_blank">downloaded here</a>. A good starting point for learning Dapr is the [Dapr Quickstarts repository](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts) on GitHub. Do you have questions about Dapr? Please join the [Dapr Discord](https://bit.ly/dapr-discord) and ask away!
