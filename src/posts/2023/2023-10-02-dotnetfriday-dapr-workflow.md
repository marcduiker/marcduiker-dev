[Eduard Keilhotlz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduard-keilholz/) invited me to talk at a [DotnetFriday](https://dotnetfriday.nl/) event many months ago, but there were always clashes with my agenda. Last Friday it finally happened, I went to the 4DotNet office in Nieuwegein and gave a talk about orchestrating your business logic with [Dapr workflow](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/workflow-overview/).

When I arrived there I was welcomed with a cake, since earlier that week it was my birthday! ðŸŽ‚ Thank you so much for this lovely surprise!

I finally met with [Kenny Baas-Schwegler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenny-baas/) again, who gave a session after me, together with [Bruno Boucard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunoboucard/), about refactoring towards deeper insights using Domain-Driven Design. This was a great example of DDD in practise with live coding.

Thanks everyone for attending this event and asking great questions about Dapr workflow.
