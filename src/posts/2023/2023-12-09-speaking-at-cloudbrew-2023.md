Last Thursday and Friday I was in Mechelen (BE) for [Cloudbrew 2023](https://www.cloudbrew.be/). I gave my session _"Lights, camera, action! Building distributed applications with Dapr Actors"_ on Friday in the auditorium.

It was my second time at CloudBrew, and I really enjoy this mid-size conference held in Lamot conference center, a former beer brewery üç∫. Kudos to the crew for organizing such a welcoming event. I look forward to the next edition!

A special shout-out goes to [Alex Mang](https://twitter.com/iamalexmang) for giving a great introduction to Dapr by giving examples how it speeds up microservice development üöÄ.
