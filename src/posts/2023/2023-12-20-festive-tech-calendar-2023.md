I'm a big fan of community driven tech events, and [Festive Tech Calendar](https://festivetechcalendar.com/) is one of them. It's a virtual advent calendar for the tech community, where each day in December new content is released that is created by the community. This year I submitted a session about creating a workflow with Dapr and .NET, and made it in a Christmas theme. The session is called _"How Santa orchestrates the elves with Dapr Workflow"_ and covers workflow application patterns such as chaining, fan-out/fan-in, and child workflows.

The Santa Claus Workflow demo is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/diagrid-labs/santa-claus-workflow).

A big shout-out goes to the [organizers](https://twitter.com/_cloudfamily) as they always combine this event with a charity ðŸ’ª.
