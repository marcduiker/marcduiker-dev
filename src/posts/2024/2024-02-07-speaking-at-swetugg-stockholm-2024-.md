This week I'm at [Swetugg Stockholm](https://www.swetugg.se/sthlm-2024) where I just gave my session _"One API to rule them all: serverless Dapr"_. This is a brand-new session, where I talked about the various Dapr deployment models, and demonstrated [Diagrid Catalyst](https://www.diagrid.io/catalyst), a new product that offers true serverless Dapr APIs for communication, data, and workflow. Thanks to everyone who attended my session, the room was fully packed!

As usual, I brought plenty of Dapr stickers for the attendees, and I also brought some Dutch stroopwafels to share with the other speakers.

Shout-out to the Swetugg organizers, they put together a great program, a lovely speaker dinner, and put a lot of effort in creating a relaxing environment for their speakers üôè.

If you want to know more about Diagrid Catalyst, please visit the [Diagrid website](https://www.diagrid.io/catalyst). You can sign up for the early access program there. I'd love go get your feedback on the product!
