I've been responsible for quite some event sponsorships that involve a sponsor booth with staff. I've condensed all the actions into this checklist that so you (and I) don't have to start from scratch every time we sponsor an event!

## Before the event

- Write down what the goal is for sponsoring the event and inform everyone involved about this goal.
- Check if the event has a Code of Conduct (CoC) with contact information.
- Sign up to sponsor the event.
- Pay for the sponsorship.
- Order additional booth equipment (monitors) or furniture (tables/desks/laptop stands).
- Order laptops/tablets for demos/presentations.
- Design & order a booth backdrop or roll-up banner.
- Design datasheets/flyers to handout at the booth.
- Order paper datasheets/flyers. Or choose the environmental consious option and use QR codes at the booth.
- Design & order stickers.
- If you have datasheets/flyers/stickers: order display stands for these so your booth stays tidy.
- Create a slide deck or video to play on a big monitor at the booth (or do something fun and create a game!).
- Find & order sustainable swag or prizes to give away at the booth.
- Decide what is the _Best Next Step_ for a booth visitor once they talked to you? Do you point them to your website, do you want them to book a meeting? Prepare a document with QR codes or create an online form to facilitate these _Best Next Steps_.
- Prepare a [_Know Before You Go_](#know-before-you-go-document) document and share this with the people who will staff the booth.
- Send calendar invites to the booth staff so they know when they should be at the booth. Include a link to the _Know Before You Go_ doc).
- Set up lead scanning. Can the default scoring/questions be changed?
- Label all the hardware that you'll bring to the booth with company name / email. Ensure everything is insured.
- If the booth staff are staying overnight, schedule a team dinner for them.
- Setup a group chat for the booth staff using your fav communication tool that everyone has on their phone. Use this to quickly get in touch with each other.
- Things to bring to the event:  breath mints, toothbrush, pain killers, blister patches, band aids, Dextro energy tablets.

### Know Before You Go document

The Know Before You Go (KBYG) document contains practical information for everyone staffing the booth.

- Contains links to:
  - Event website
  - Google Maps of the venue location
  - Code of Conduct of the event
- Contact details of event organizers, sponsor/technical support, code of conduct team.
- The booth schedule: who will be on the booth, on which days including start and end times.
  - Include when the breaks between sessions are, since those are the busiest times at the booth.
  - Who will set up the booth?
  - Who will break down the booth?
  - Who will pick up and return the lead scanner?
- Prepare a script how to start a conversation when attendees stop by the booth.
  - Questions to find out if the attendee is part of your target audience.
  - Concrete examples of how your product/service is helping organizations. Use specific numbers to indicate increase in efficiency or reduction in cost.
- Describe the _Next Best Steps_ for your audience.

## During the event

- Pick up the lead scanner.
- Set up the booth backdrop / roll-up banner.
- Prepare the booth with datasheets/flyers/stickers/swag.
- Talk to people who show interest. Don't harrass people just to get more badge scans. Be kind and act how *you* would like to be approached. Use the script(s) from the KBYG doc and use the _Best Next Steps_ that are suitable for the attendees.
- Drink water and stay hydrated.
- Take lots of pictures. Ask for consent if these pictures include event attendees. Share the pictures on social media during the day or immediately after.

## After the event

- Write an [_Event Report_](#event-report-document) that summarizes the event.
- Give feedback to the event organizers based on the event report.
- Send post-event social messages thanking the organizers and attendees. Include some of the pictures.
- If relevant sessions have been recorded on video, share them via social media once they are published.

### Event Report document

Questions to answer in an event report:

- Was the goal that you set met?
- What went well?
- What didn't go well?
- What are concrete improvement points for next time?
- How many datasheets/stickers/swag were ordered. Was this enough?
- What was the overal cost of sponsoring?
- Is it worth sponsoring this event again?
