On December 12 & 13, I was at [CloudBrew](https://www.cloudbrew.be/) in Belgium to give my session *'Failure is not an option: Durable Execution + Dapr = üöÄ'*.

CloudBrew is a conference with a focus on cloud technologies, primarily Microsoft Azure. It's located in a former brewery in Mechelen, a place close to Antwerp. I highly recommend visiting this city, it has a lovely pittoresque city center.

At the conference, it was amazing to see all the Dapr coverage across several sessions! Thank you Alex Mang, Eduard Keilholz, and Anthony Chu for mentioning Dapr in your sessions! üôè

For my session, I tried a new approach: I used [DemoTime,](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eliostruyf.vscode-demo-time) a VSCode extension created by [Elio Struyf](https://bsky.app/profile/eliostruyf.com), to navigate through my slides (Markdown) and code, and also execute the `dapr run` commands for my demos. It worked out really well, give DemoTime a try!

This is the [repo with the demos](https://github.com/diagrid-labs/dapr-resiliency-and-durable-execution). It comes with a devcontainer configuration so you can run it yourself easily, either on GitHub Codespaces or locally.

I had a lovely time at CloudBrew again this year. I like the cozy scale of this conference, and it's clear the organizers have been doing this for many years. I had good conversations with Dapr enthusiasts (I hope to welcome you on the [Dapr Discord](https://bit.ly/dapr-discord)!) and it was great meeting with other speakers and the organizers again. Until next time!
