From September 3-4 I was in Germany to speak at the [ContainerDays Conference](https://www.containerdays.io/containerdays-conference-2024/). I heard a lot of good stories about this conference but never had the opportunity to attend or speak, so I was thrilled to finally speak there!

My session was on the first day of the conference and was titled: _Start building distributed applications with ease using building block APIs_. In this session, I gave an introduction to the [Dapr OSS](https://dapr.io/) project, demonstrated the service invocation, state management, and pub/sub APIs, and showed how Dapr has built-in [resiliency](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/resiliency/policies/).

All the code I demonstrated can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/diagrid-labs/dapr-resiliency-and-durable-execution). Check the [ResiliencyDemo](https://github.com/diagrid-labs/dapr-resiliency-and-durable-execution/tree/main/ResiliencyDemo) folder and the corresponding CodeTour. The slides I used are part of the Dapr OSS slide deck which can be downloaded from the [Dapr docs](https://docs.dapr.io/contributing/presentations/).

I had a great time at this conference, I had good conversations with Dapr enthusiasts (I hope to welcome you on the [Dapr Discord](https://bit.ly/dapr-discord)!), and connected with the organizers of [KCD Munich](https://www.kcdmunich.de/), I'd love to join you next year! During the speaker dinner I sat next to Raymond de Jong, who I never met before, but we lived in the same small Dutch city for years. It was great to meet you!

Thanks again to the organizers for accepting my talk, the lovely MCs, and the attendees for joining my session, it's great to speak for a full room! I hope we meet again next year!
