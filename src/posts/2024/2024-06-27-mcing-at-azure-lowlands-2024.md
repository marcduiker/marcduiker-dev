On June 27th I was at [Azure & AI Lowlands](https://azurelowlands.com/), Utrecht, The Netherlands. Not as a speaker this time, but I was MC-ing ðŸŽ¤ in one of the rooms! I'm a big fan of the Azure Lowlands conferences, I love the venue *The Fabrique*, an old industrial area, and the conference always has a good mix of topics, diverse speakers, and plenty of entertainment. The theme of this year was *'The 80s'* ðŸ¤© and the opening act was a singing group of roller skaters, a skateboarder, and a BMX rider performing stunts on a half pipe! ðŸ¤¯

I really enjoy MC-ing! I met many new speakers and listened to sessions which I probably wouldn't have attended normally. Since I was MC-ing in the *Thriller* room, I presented a small fact about the [Thriller music video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson%27s_Thriller_(music_video)) each time a new session started.

The organizers did a great job with the 80s theme. There were 80s characters, cars (KITT, Ecto-1, A-team van), and of course lots of 80s music. I had a great time at Azure & AI Lowlands, and I'm looking forward to the next edition!
