From March 19-22 KubeCon Europe was taking place in Paris. Diagrid was sponsoring both [AppDeveloperCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/co-located-events/appdevelopercon/) and [KubeCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/), and I was responsible for the booths, swag, a Dapr demo to highlight a new free edition of [one of our products](https://www.diagrid.io/conductor), and a [retro game](./133.dapr-game.md) to attract people to the booth.

A week before KubeCon I recorded a video to announce our presence at the event:

My colleagues did a ton of talks at both the co-located event and KubeCon, and I had the opportunity to give a lightning talk about Dapr. It was my first time speaking at KubeCon, so I was quite excited for this!

I had a great time at the booth, talking to loads of people about Dapr and the Diagrid products. Many attendees (and other sponsors) played the Dapr retro game, took the pixelart stickers, or the multi tool, our give-away, that symbolizes Dapr and all of its APIs.

It was great seeing my colleagues again, and meeting with many Dapr enthusiasts & end-users IRL for the first time! ðŸŽ‰

I'm really exhausted after 4 conference days, but I'm also very happy with the result. Now, I'll go to sleep for two days ðŸ˜´.
