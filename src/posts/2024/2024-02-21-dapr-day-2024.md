On Feb 21st Cecil Phillip and I MC-ed Dapr Day 2024, an online conference to learn all about the Dapr APIs for building distributed applications and best practices to run your apps in production.

Next to MC-ing the event, I also was responsible for organizing the event, assembling a program committee, reviewing sessions, communicating with the speakers, and video editing. Thanks to the CNCF for using their platform for the CfPs and streaming the event! üôè

I'm looking forward to the next Dapr Day! üòÅ
