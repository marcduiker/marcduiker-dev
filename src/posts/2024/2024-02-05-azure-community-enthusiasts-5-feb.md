On Feb 5th I was a guest speaker at Azure Community Enthusiasts, a bi-weekly live show on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AzureCommUG) about anything related to the Azure cloud. I gave a session about Dapr, the Distributed Application Runtime. The other guest was Will Velida, who gave an introduction to Radius.
