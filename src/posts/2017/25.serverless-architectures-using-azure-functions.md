## Techdays 2017

A few weeks ago I was presented with a fantastic opportunity, to speak at the biggest Microsoft conference in the Netherlands, TechDays 2017. The session was about my favorite subjects nowadays, serverless architectures and Azure Functions.

## So long, and thanks for all the fish!

I had a great time at TechDays, I enjoyed speaking as well as attending numerous great sessions. It was a lot of fun being there with all my colleagues.

At the end of the conference the two fish which were present at our Xpirit stand did not have a place to go, so I decided to adopt them :).
