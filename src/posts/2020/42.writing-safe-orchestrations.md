## Writing Safe Orchestrations

This post is the fifth part of a series of blogs/vlogs to discover the Durable Functions API.

In the video linked below, I'm diving into the [Durable Task Analyzer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-extension/releases/tag/Analyzer-v0.3.0), which is bundled with the Durable Functions extension. This C# Roslyn analyzer helps you to write deterministic code for your orchestrators, so it's safe to be replayed. The analyzer detects code violations which are described on [this docs page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-code-constraints).
