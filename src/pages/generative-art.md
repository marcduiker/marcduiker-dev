## Happy accidents

I really love creative coding. It feels quite different compared to coding for work. When I code for work, I do it to achieve a very specific goal; to implement a feature that adds value, or to demonstrate how a technology works. With creative coding, the goal is to create something fun or beautiful, where the result is often achieved by happy accidents.

If you're interested in learning (visual) creative coding, I can definitely recommend [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) channel on YouTube. Daniel Shiffman is an amazing teacher, I want to be like him when I grow up ðŸ˜….

Creative coding is also ideal for educational purposes. It's very rewarding for students to see (or hear) the result of their coding exercises.

## Generative art

I create hand-crafted generative art under the pseudonym of _[_md](https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/_md)_. I mostly use JavaScript with [P5js](https://p5js.org/), a library for creative coding based on Processing.

You can collect my digital art on [fx(hash)](https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/_md).

## Open source sketches

### Pixels

This is an interactive sketch, move the mouse (or touch) to change the pixel color variation.

### Dynamic Soll Lewitt

This is an interactive sketch, click around the center of the sketch and the drawing will remain in place. Move away from the center and the drawing will move in that direction. Nodes will disappear when they are close to the edge.

### Scalable ASCII Video

In this video I demonstrate a scalable ASCII video renderer made with p5js:
